(* The terminology in this specification comes not from that version, but  *)

(* Algorithm".  (See EWD840.tla at https://git.io/JDBfG for the TLA+       *)
(* specification of the "Ring Algorithm" described in that book, and       *)

(* the tree algorithm.)                                                    *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* We assume a network of processes that perform a computation.  What they *)
(* computed is irrelevant for this specification.  All we care is that     *)
(* each process is either idle or busy computing.  A busy process can send *)
(* messages to other processes.  Receipt of a message makes a process      *)
(* busy; a busy process may become idle at any time.  Initially, only a    *)
(* single process called the leader is busy; all other processes are idle. *)
(* The leader starts the distributed computation by sending messages to    *)
(* some of the processes of the network.  We want an algorithm that        *)
(* informs the leader when the computation has terminated, which is when   *)
(* all processes are idle and there are no messages in transit.            *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The network is described by a directed graph having the processes as    *)
(* its nodes.  A process p can send messages to a process q if and only if *)
(* there is an edge from p to q.  We assume there are no edges pointing to *)
(* the leader, so it can send messages but not receive them.  The          *)
(* termination-detection algorithm may introduce additional control        *)
(* messages, which are distinct from the computation's messages.  If there *)
(* is an edge from process p to process q, then we assume control messages *)
(* can be sent from q to p in addition to the computation messages sent    *)
(* from p to q.                                                            *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* Suppose that the graph describing the network is a directed tree having *)
(* the leader as its root.  That means that it has no cycles and there is  *)
(* a unique path from the leader to each node.  If there is an edge from   *)
(* process p to process q, we say that p is the parent of q and q is a     *)
(* child of p.  The descendants of a process are the nodes reachable from  *)
(* that process.  For such a graph, we can use the following algorithm.    *)
(* For each message a child receives from its parent, it must eventually   *)
(* send a control message, called an acknowledgment (ack), to its parent.  *)
(* A process can send an ack to its parent any time after it receives the  *)
(* corresponding message, with one restriction: It can send the last ack   *)
(* (for the messages it has received thus far) to its parent only when it  *)
(* is idle and it has received acks for all the messages it has sent to    *)
(* its children.  Define a process to be neutral if it is idle and has     *)
(* sent acks to its parent for every message it has received (from its     *)
(* parent).  An induction argument shows that, for such a graph, the       *)
(* algorithm maintains the following invariant: if a node is neutral, then *)
(* all its descendants are neutral.  From this it follows that, when the   *)
(* leader is neutral, all processes are neutral, which implies that all     *)
(* processes are idle and all computation messages have been received, so  *)
(* the computation has terminated.                                         *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The basic idea of the Dijkstra-Scholten Tree Algorithm is to handle an  *)
(* arbitrary network by applying the algorithm described above to a        *)
(* dynamically constructed "overlay" tree.  In an arbitrary network, a     *)
(* process can receive messages from more than one other process.  It      *)
(* sends an ack to the sender of each message it receives.  We define a    *)
(* process to be neutral if it is idle, has sent acks for every message it *)
(* has received, and has received acks for every message it has sent.      *)
(* Initially, every process but the leader is neutral.  The overlay tree   *)
(* is constructed by making the process from which a neutral process p     *)
(* receives a message (making p non-neutral) the parent of p.  Process p   *)
(* can send its last ack to its parent only when doing so makes it         *)
(* neutral--that is, only when it is idle, has received acks for all       *)
(* messages it has sent, and has sent acks for all messages it has         *)
(* received except for one of the messages it has received from its        *)
(* parent.  The algorithm maintains the invariant that all non-neutral     *)
(* processes form a tree rooted at the leader.  Thus, when the leader is   *)
(* neutral, all other processes are also neutral and the computation has   *)
(* terminated.                                                             *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The algorithm allows asynchronous, unordered message delivery, but it   *)
(* assumes (computation and control) messages are not lost.  Non-Byzantine *)
(* process failures cannot cause the leader to believe that a              *)
(* non-terminated computation has terminated, but it can cause termination *)
(* not to be detected.  It requires that a process can send acknowledgment *)
(* messages to any process that can send it computation messages.          *)
