# Every line starting with # is a comment line
# Every non-blank non-comment line lists a directory to ignore in the CI
# This will keep parse or model check failures from failing the CI workflow
# Note that directory names are case-sensitive
# Example:
specifications/doesnotexist

# Ignore submodules to ensure deterministic local execution
specifications/BlockingQueue
specifications/CCF
